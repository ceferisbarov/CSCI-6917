# Week 5
I spent week 5 writing the interim report. You can find it in `summer.pdf` file.

# Week 6
I have been working on the software and utilities necessary to finalize the project.

Client folder contains the code for the Streamlit application. Server folder contains the FastAPI code. Docker is used for deployment. `docker-compose.yml` functions as the glue that holds everything together.

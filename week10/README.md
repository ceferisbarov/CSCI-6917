# Week 10
Done:
* I have started to transform my current project to a thesis topic. To this end, I have had discussions with several researchers (Sheffield, Delft, GWU). It is possible that I will continue on a related but separate topic.
* I have contributed to open-source projects that form the basis of my research. Our discussion has resulted on this change:  
https://github.com/Julia-XAI/XAIBase.jl/pull/20  
https://github.com/Julia-XAI/ExplainableAI.jl/pull/166

These changes solve the compatibility issue between `Transformers.jl` and `ExplainableAI.jl` packages. While not directly related to my project, I could say it is a result of my involvment in the project.

* I have discovered and read another paper on the topic: *XP ROMPT: Explaining Large Language Modelâ€™s
Generation via Joint Prompt Attribution.* This paper improves upon the *ReAGent* paper that I had mentioned in week 8 report.

To do:
* I will compile a small evaluation dataset and annotate it manually. This will help me compare my method against other existing ones.

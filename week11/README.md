# Week 12
I spent final week of the class preparing the presentation. I had to review the original proposal, interim report and my progress to finalize the document.  

I also fixed several minor bugs in software, but none of them was significant.  

I finalized the benchmarking process. Results will be available in the presentation.  The dataset was sampled from alpaca dataset by Stanford. I have added a code sample to this folder.  

Although not directly related, I have also spent some time revising my thesis proposal after discussions with several people.

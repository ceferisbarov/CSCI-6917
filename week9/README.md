# Week 9

We had two goals for this week:
- Integrate replace-roberta with the existing infrastructure.
- Deploy the first version in Streamlit Cloud.

The first task has been completed. The last version of the code is available at [feature-attribution-webapp](https://github.com/ceferisbarov/feature-attribution-webapp) repo on GitHub.  
  
The deployment part is proving more challenging, because my Docker containers are abnormally large, with multi-step installation process. I am currently working to solve these problems.  
  
I am also working on developing other methods. If these work out, we will give the user several options to choose from.
